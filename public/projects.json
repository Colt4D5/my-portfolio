                  "learned": "through this large and extensive project, i learned how amazing react.js truly is. the scalability, the maintainability, and the intuitive component-based system is an amazing framework that i'm excited to explore more of."},

                  "learned": "my main focus throughout this course was maintaining the knowledge gained therein and it was due to this mission that i chose to try much of the work myself before i participated in the course material, only referring to it when i was unable to proceed on my own. this, i believe, led to a successful and highly educational course wherein i learned invaluable skills that i now incorporate into my work."},
