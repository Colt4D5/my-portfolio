  ## Projects:

  ### Netflix Clone

  This was a great project, and my biggest to date in scope, in which I learned a lot about functional components and how they are related to one another.

  ### Forkify Recipe Application

  This was the final project in Jonas Schmedtmann's extensive 70-hour JavaScript course and broadened my perspective of what JavaScript is truly capable of. I loved working on this project because I loved watching the evolution process from simple website to complex application with api calls and much more.
