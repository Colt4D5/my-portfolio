  Within my portfolio, you will find links to the source code on github as well as links to the live sites for each project, some of which are hosted through Netlify, and another using firebase.

  ## Projects:

  ### Netflix Clone

  This was a great project, and my biggest to date in scope, in which I learned a lot about functional components and how they are related to one another.

  ### Forkify Recipe Application

  This was the final project in Jonas Schmedtmann's extensive 70-hour JavaScript course and broadened my perspective of what JavaScript is truly capable of. I loved working on this project because I loved watching the evolution process from simple website to complex application with api calls and much more.

  ### Bake Me Better Bakery

  This was my first solo project and I enjoyed every minute building this application. Because I owned and operated my own Custom Bakery for 12 years, I thought it only fitting to create a web app for a bakery.

  ### Current Weather React App

  This was my first little project as I began my journey into React.js, and I was very happy with it. In addition to the current weather to various search locations using api calls, I also implemented geolocation so that it immediately finds your location and gives you the weather from wherever you are in the world right now.

  ### At the bottom, you will also find a functional contact form that I implemented using Email.js as well as my resume, which you can view or download for your convenience.

Thank you for taking the time to check out my website. I hope to speak with you soon.
